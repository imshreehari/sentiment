README for sentiment.py
Created by Scott Tarlow with help from Mika Wang and Adrian Hodge, 2016

sentiment.py uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of a tweet.
Included are an example training set and set of tweets
Inputs: Training_Set.txt, _input.txt file
Output: Predicted Sentiment (-1,0,1) of each tweet in a text file

This code can be easily modified for anyone's uses. The rating system for the sentiment is
determined by the training set:

"string value" "sentiment score"

see Training_Set.txt for expected format of the training set.

This can determine the sentment of any string of words, given a large enough Training Set.

Raw output can be analyzed by any software you like!
